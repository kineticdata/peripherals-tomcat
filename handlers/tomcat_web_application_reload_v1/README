== Tomcat Web Application Reload
Reloads a web application running on a Tomcat web server.

This handler requires a user defined in the tomcat-users.xml file that is
a member of the 'manager-script' role.

This handler requires the Tomcat server has a user (conf/tomcat-users.xml)
configured with the manager-script role because it accesses the /manager/text/...
routes which require this.

Assuming all the parameters are configured, this handler can still fail on
the following known conditions:
  1 - User credentials are incorrect
  2 - User credentials do not have the manager-script role (conf/tomcat-users.xml)

If the web application context is entered incorrectly, the Tomcat manager
application will not report an error.  Your web application will obviously
not be reloaded and there won't be any warning.
